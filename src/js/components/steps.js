        text: `A certain king had a beautiful garden, 
        and in the garden stood a tree which bore golden apples. 
        These apples were always counted, and about the time when they began 
        to grow ripe it was found that every night one of them was gone. 
        The king became very angry at this, and ordered the gardener to 
        keep watch all night under the tree. The gardener set his eldest 
        son to watch; but about twelve o’clock he fell asleep, and in the 
        morning another of the apples was missing. Then the second son was 
        ordered to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the 
        morning another apple was gone. Then the third son offered to keep 
        watch; but the gardener at first would not let him, for fear some 
        harm should come to him: however, at last he consented, and the young 
        man laid himself under the tree to watch.`,

        text: `Time passed on again, and the youngest son too wished to set 
        out into the wide world to seek for the golden bird; but his father 
        would not listen to it for a long while, for he was very fond of his 
        son, and was afraid that some ill luck might happen to him also, and 
        prevent his coming back. However, at last it was agreed he should go, 
        for he would not rest at home; and as he came to the wood, he met the 
        fox, and heard the same good counsel. But he was thankful to the fox, 
        and did not attempt his life as his brothers had done; so the fox said, 
        ‘Sit upon my tail, and you will travel faster.’ So he sat down, and the 
        fox began to run, and away they went over stock and stone so quick that 
        their hair whistled in the wind.`,

        text: `There was once an old castle, that stood in the middle of a 
        deep gloomy wood, and in the castle lived an old fairy. Now this fairy 
        could take any shape she pleased. All the day long she flew about in 
        the form of an owl, or crept about the country like a cat; but at night 
        she always became an old woman again. When any young man came within 
        a hundred paces of her castle, he became quite fixed, and could not 
        move a step till she came and set him free; which she would not do till 
        he had given her his word never to come there again: but when any pretty 
        maiden came within that space she was changed into a bird, and the 
        fairy put her into a cage, and hung her up in a chamber in the castle.`,
