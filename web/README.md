Recruitment task for UXPin

## Frontend APP

### Install project dependencies
```
npm install
```

### Run the server
```
npm run dev
```

> The application is running now, so open a browser and navigate to **_localhost:8080_**

### Usage

I assume, that user will get link with some hash, that will
be identify him, for example:

`http://localhost:8080/HvQ_00Urba`

If it will not be hash in url, app will create it and modify url. 
But in this scenario, user need to "copy" this url, and paste it on another
computer to see the same step.
